- [x] tuples in C's FnTy
- [Â½] slotted/efficient array allocations
- [ ] Abstract function intermediates
  - [ ] better tuple-iteration
  - [ ] write-to-destination without allocation for arrays
    (separate `fill` function)
      - [ ] also when passing array args, dim &c. in an `AD` structure
- [ ] lift integer constants out of loop
- [x] worklist for use-defs (p. 402 appel)
- [ ] loop tiling/blocking for re-rank (and map etc.)
- [ ] efficient index-associated-with-loop: specify "at" addressed bound to
  for-loop, which is turned into something w/ strength reduction, post-index
    offset
    - [ ] see index in debug, no need for strength reduction...
- [ ] DNA type
- [ ] C type
- [ ] Einstein notation
- [ ] specify iteration by wallpaper group...
