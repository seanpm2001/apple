\title{Apple Array Allocation}
\author{V. E. McHale}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    Array languages like J and APL suffer from a lack of embedability in implementations. Adroit memory management can make embedding easier; one would like to avoid thinking about ownership across two garbage collectors. Here I present statically determined memory allocation used in the Apple array system. Ownership is simple and Apple code does not constrain memory management in the host language.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

The language is expression-oriented (immutable); there are no references.

\section{Method}

Our work is based on classical liveness algorithms.

%, though we must tag additional information when generating the IR.

The IR used in the Apple compiler is sequences of statements and expressions.

\begin{verbatim}
newtype ArrayExp = ArrayPointer Temp (Maybe Exp) (Maybe Int) -- register, offset, label

data Exp = Const Int
         | Reg Temp
         | At ArrayExp
         ...

data Stmt = Malloc Int Temp Exp -- label, register, size
          | Write ArrayExp Exp
          ...
\end{verbatim}

As an example, suppose we wish to generate an array and extract the first element:

\begin{verbatim}
 > {. (irange 0 99 1)
0
\end{verbatim}

Under the hood:

\begin{verbatim}
 > :ir {. (irange 0 99 1)
(movtemp r_2 (int 0))
(movtemp r_3 (int 99))
(movtemp r_1 (- (reg r_3) (reg r_2)))
(malloc r_0 : (+ (asl (reg r_1) (int 3)) (int 24)))
(write (ptr r_0) (int 1))
(write (ptr r_0+(int 8)) (reg r_1))
(movtemp r_4 (int 16))

apple_0:
(mjump (> (reg r_2) (reg r_3)) apple_1)
(write (ptr r_0+(reg r_4)) (reg r_2))
(movtemp r_2 (+ (reg r_2) (int 1)))
(movtemp r_4 (+ (reg r_4) (int 8)))
(j apple_0)

apple_1:
(movtemp r_ret @(ptr r_0+(int 16)))
(free r_0)
\end{verbatim}

That is, the array that is allocated is freed precisely after all relevant operations have completed.

\section{Coda}

Apple has the potential to be far more efficient; type information could be used to consolidate allocations.
